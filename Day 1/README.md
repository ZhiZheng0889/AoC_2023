# Documentation: Why This Code Works

This code is designed to process a text file by performing two main tasks:

1. **Calculating a Calibration Value from Text:**
   - The calibration process involves summing specific digits from each line of the text. The digits are derived by taking the first and last digits present in each line, removing any alphabetical characters in between.

2. **Replacing Words with Encoded Forms and Recalculating the Calibration:**
   - Certain words in the text are mapped to encoded forms where specific letters are replaced with corresponding digits. After replacing these words, the calibration is recalculated using the same method as above.

## Key Components:

1. **Text Loading (`load_text`)**:
   - The code starts by loading the text from a file. This function ensures that the text is read correctly and passed into further processing.

2. **Word Mapping (`get_str2num_mapping`)**:
   - A dictionary is used to map specific words (e.g., "one", "two") to their encoded forms (e.g., "o1e", "t2o"). This mapping is essential for transforming the text in the second part of the task.

3. **Word Replacement (`replace_words`)**:
   - This function iterates over the text and replaces all occurrences of the mapped words with their encoded versions. It ensures that the text is modified according to the rules defined by the `str2num` mapping.

4. **Digit Extraction and Summing (`extract_digits_and_sum`)**:
   - For each line of the text, this function removes non-digit characters, extracts the first and last digits, and calculates their sum. This step is crucial for both the original and modified text calibration.

5. **Calibration Calculation (`calibration`)**:
   - This function processes the entire text, line by line, using `extract_digits_and_sum` to compute the calibration sum. It ensures that the calibration is accurate for both the original and transformed text.

6. **Main Process (`main`)**:
   - The `main` function orchestrates the overall flow: it reads the text, calculates the initial calibration, replaces words with encoded forms, and recalculates the calibration for the transformed text. This step-by-step process ensures that both tasks are completed accurately and the results are printed.

## Why the Code Works:

- **Modularity**: The code is broken into small, single-responsibility functions that each perform a specific task. This ensures that each part of the process is handled correctly and can be easily understood, tested, and debugged.

- **Correct Handling of Text Transformations**: The `replace_words` function accurately transforms the text according to the specified mapping, ensuring that the calibration recalculation reflects these changes.

- **Accurate Digit Extraction**: The `extract_digits_and_sum` function correctly identifies and sums the first and last digits of each line, which is central to the calibration calculation.

- **Logical Flow**: The `main` function ensures that the tasks are performed in the correct order, with each step building on the previous one to produce the final output.

By adhering to these principles, the code reliably achieves the desired outcomes, making it both functional and maintainable.
