# Advent of Code Day 6 Solution

## Overview

This code provides a solution to a puzzle that involves calculating the number of valid button hold times needed to beat a record distance in a series of races. The solution is divided into two parts:

1. **Part 1:** Calculates the product of the valid hold times across all races.
2. **Part 2:** Calculates the number of valid hold times for a single, concatenated long race.

## How the Code Works

### 1. Function Definitions

- **`count_valid_hold_times(total_time, record_distance)`**
  
  This function calculates the number of valid button hold times that will allow a player to beat a given record distance for a race. It works by solving a quadratic equation derived from the constraints of the problem:
  
  - **Quadratic Formula Application:** 
    The function solves the quadratic equation `t^2 - total_time * t + record_distance = 0` to determine the valid range of hold times `t` where the player can just beat the record.
    
  - **Range of Valid Times:** 
    The function then calculates the range of valid times (between `min_valid_time` and `max_valid_time`) by adjusting the roots of the quadratic equation to integer values.
    
  - **Return Value:**
    The function returns the count of valid integers within this range, which is the number of valid ways to hold the button to beat the record.

### 2. Input Processing

- The code reads input data from a file containing the race times and record distances.
  
- **File Structure:**
  - The first line of the file contains the race times as a space-separated list of integers.
  - The second line of the file contains the record distances as a space-separated list of integers.

- **Parsing:**
  - The code extracts the numerical values from each line using regular expressions (`re.findall`) and converts them into lists of integers.

### 3. Part 1: Valid Hold Times Across All Races

- **Loop Through Races:**
  The code loops through each race time and corresponding record distance, calling the `count_valid_hold_times` function for each pair.
  
- **Product Calculation:**
  The results from each race are multiplied together using the `prod` function from the `math` module to get the total number of valid ways to win all races.

- **Output:**
  The result is printed to the console.

### 4. Part 2: Valid Hold Times for a Single Long Race

- **Concatenation:**
  The code concatenates all digits from the race times and record distances into single integers.

- **Calculation:**
  The `count_valid_hold_times` function is called with the concatenated values to calculate the number of valid hold times for this single long race.

- **Output:**
  The result is printed to the console.
