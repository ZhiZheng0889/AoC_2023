        "# Advent of Code Day 5 Solution\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This Python script solves the Advent of Code Day 5 puzzle, where the task is to map seed numbers through a series of transformation rules to find the minimum corresponding location number. The script is designed to handle both parts of the puzzle:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Part 1**: Processes each seed number individually.\n",
        "2. **Part 2**: Processes seeds as pairs of ranges and maps the entire range to find the minimum location.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Script Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Input Handling**\n",
        "   - The script reads the input data from a file named `AoC_2023_Day5.txt`.\n",
        "   - The input is split into two main sections:\n",
        "     - **Seed Numbers**: A list of integers representing seed numbers.\n",
        "     - **Transformation Rules**: A series of rules that map seed numbers through various categories (soil, fertilizer, water, etc.) to find the final location.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Seed Extraction**\n",
        "   - The seed numbers are extracted from the first section of the input and converted into a list of integers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Transformation Rules Extraction**\n",
        "   - The transformation rules are extracted from the subsequent sections of the input. Each rule specifies how to map a seed or seed range from one category to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **`map_values_through_rule` Function**\n",
        "   - This function takes a list of seed ranges and a transformation rule.\n",
        "   - It maps each seed (or range of seeds) through the transformation rule:\n",
        "     - If the seed falls within a specified source range, it is mapped to the corresponding destination range.\n",
        "     - The function yields the mapped seed value and the length of the range that was mapped.\n",
        "     - If a seed does not match any source range, it is yielded as is.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **`calculate_minimum_location` Function**\n",
        "   - This function applies all transformation rules to each seed or seed range to find the minimum location number.\n",
        "   - It uses the `reduce` function to apply the `map_values_through_rule` function across all rules, progressively transforming the seed values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Part 1: Individual Seed Processing**\n",
        "   - Each seed is treated individually, and the script calculates the minimum location by mapping each seed through the transformation rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Part 2: Seed Range Processing**\n",
        "   - Seeds are treated as pairs of ranges, where each pair specifies the start and length of a range of seed numbers.\n",
        "   - The script calculates the minimum location by expanding each seed range and applying the transformation rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **Output**\n",
        "   - The script prints the minimum location number for both Part 1 and Part 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "- Ensure that the input file `AoC_2023_Day5.txt` is placed in the correct directory.\n",
        "- Run the script in a Python environment to obtain the minimum location numbers for both parts of the puzzle.\n",
        "\n"
