        "\n",
        "- **Part 1**: The function `solve_part1()` checks which games are possible given specific cube limits (12 red, 13 green, 14 blue). It then sums the IDs of all possible games.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Part 2**: The function `solve_part2()` calculates the minimum number of cubes required for each game to be possible, computes the \"power\" (product of minimum required cubes for red, green, and blue), and sums these powers across all games.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`parse_game(game)`**:\n",
        "   - Parses a game string to extract the game ID and determine the maximum number of red, green, and blue cubes needed in any subset of that game.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`solve_part1(file_path)`**:\n",
        "   - Reads the input file, uses `parse_game()` to check each game against the cube limits, and returns the sum of the IDs of all games that meet the criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`solve_part2(file_path)`**:\n",
        "   - Reads the input file, uses `parse_game()` to calculate the minimum required cubes for each game, computes the power of these sets, and returns the sum of these powers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Usage\n",
        "\n",
